# Commands and registration

What each `amika-hostd` command does, and how `up` and `register-url` register
the host with Amika.

## Commands

`src/index.ts` is the `amika-hostd` bin; `src/internal/cli.ts` parses commands
with `node:util` `parseArgs` and takes every side effect as a dependency.

- `amika-hostd setup` asks for the hostname and API key, generates the secret
  key, and writes them (see [Setup](setup-and-secrets.md#setup)).
- `amika-hostd up [--port N] [--host H]` starts the daemon in the background:
  it re-runs itself as `serve --smolvm` with `detached: true`, appends output, each line
  timestamped, to `$XDG_STATE_HOME/amika-hostd/log/amika-hostd.log` (else
  `$HOME/.local/state/...`), and waits for the child's IPC `ready` message, so startup failures print in the
  caller's terminal. Only the operator's own flags are forwarded; the child
  inherits the environment and re-reads the TOML file.
- `amika-hostd up --fg` and `amika-hostd serve` run in the foreground until
  `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM`. Shutdown waits up to 5 seconds for in-flight requests,
  then drops the rest, and the process exits a second later even if a request
  to the Smol runtime is still pending, so a slow client or runtime cannot keep
  the daemon alive. A daemon running smolvm first waits up to 60s more for it
  to stop (see [smolvm](runtime.md#smolvm)). If the launching `up` exits before the
  child is ready, the child shuts down too.
  Only `up` registers with Amika; `serve` does not. `up` (either way) and
  `serve --smolvm` also run smolvm; plain `serve` does not, for development.
  Plain `serve` forwards to `SMOL_API_URL`, else to a fixed
  `http://127.0.0.1:23020` (it does no port scan), so run a hand-started
  smolvm there with `smolvm serve start --listen 127.0.0.1:23020` or point
  `SMOL_API_URL` at it.
- `amika-hostd down` sends `SIGTERM` to the daemon named by the pidfile and
  waits for it to exit, which includes stopping smolvm. It needs no
  configuration.
- `amika-hostd register-url <url>` records the host's public URL and exits.

## Registration

Before starting the daemon, `up` calls `POST /api/v0beta1/hosts` on the Amika
API (`src/internal/amika-api.ts`) with `Authorization: Bearer <API key>` and a
body of `hostname`, `secret` and `sizes`. The endpoint is
idempotent by hostname: `201` creates the host, `200` returns the existing host
and leaves its stored secret and sizes unchanged. Changing the local secret
therefore never rotates it in Amika; changing the hostname registers a new
host. On `200`, `up` then sends `PUT /api/v0beta1/hosts/{id}` with the
configured `sizes`, so edits to the `[sizes]` tables reach
Amika on the next `up` (or `register-url`). The config is the source of truth:
the PUT replaces the host's stored sizes, so a config with no `[sizes]` tables
clears them. Any other status, a network error,
or a 30s timeout aborts `up` before a daemon starts, with a message that never
includes the API key or secret. `401`/`403` from the sign-in check in front of the API carry `{ error }` rather
than `{ error_code, message }`, and that reason is kept. Redirects are refused
so credentials cannot be resent to another origin, and the error says so. On
`200`, `up` warns that Amika kept the stored secret, since a changed local
secret would make Amika's requests fail. The background daemon is spawned
without `AMIKA_API_KEY`/`AMIKA_HOSTD_API_KEY`: it only serves, so the
background daemon never holds the API key. `up` checks the pidfile before
registering, so a second `up` fails without calling Amika.

Registration is complete once Amika knows the host's internet-facing URL (an
ngrok or Cloudflare Tunnel URL, for example). `up` runs in this order: resolve
config, register the hostname and secret, start the daemon (background, or
`--fg`), then complete registration. If the host has no URL and stdin and
stdout are both terminals, `up` asks the operator to expose the now-running
daemon and enter its public URL, re-asking on an invalid URL. A blank answer or
end of input (Ctrl-D) skips it. Ctrl-C exits 130: a background daemon keeps
running, while `--fg` stops. A failed save is reported and the daemon keeps
running (`up` exits 1 in the background). Without a terminal it prints how to
finish instead of blocking. If the host already has a URL, `up` reminds the
operator that Amika expects to reach it there.

`amika-hostd register-url <url>` sets the URL from the same configuration as
`up`: it registers idempotently to learn the host's id, then sends
`PUT /api/v0beta1/hosts/{id}` with the hostname and URL and no secret, so the
stored secret is kept. Only absolute http(s) URLs without credentials are
accepted; a bare origin is normalized without its trailing slash, and a path is
kept.

Every run claims `amika-hostd.pid` in that state directory, atomically, and refuses to
start while it names a live daemon. The daemon sets `process.title` to
`amika-hostd`; where `/proc` exists, a pidfile naming any other process is
treated as stale, since the pidfile outlives reboots and pids are reused. An
empty `--host` is rejected, since it would bind every interface. Stop a
background daemon with `amika-hostd down`.
